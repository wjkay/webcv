    h4 Passion for learning 
    p The best example of this is my Graduate Diploma in Computer Science. I jumped straight into 200 and 300 level papers. Despite having few of the introductory IT papers, I have achieved a B average to date in the 300 level IT papers. I have learnt Python, Javascript, Haskell, Prolog, SQL as well as other web languages such as PHP, HTML5, XML and CSS3. I also enjoy infrastructure-orientated work and have built custom hardware from a young age. I am very rapid at, and willing to learn from everyone to get a better understanding of the IT industry and to apply this learning to improve my abilities.

    h4 Teamwork
    p I was the leader in the Capstone Project. This project is the final project for Massey Computer Scientists and required me to work and manage five other team members ( who were all doing a 3 or 4 year bachelor qualification). I learnt a great deal about how to motivate a team and to work with others to ensure the smooth running of the project. I was a member of the Petone rowing 8s, which won the National Championships at Lake Karipiro in 2006. I had to work very hard with the other members of the team and my coach to succeed at this level.

    h4 Efficient
    p My graduate diploma has a heavy workload and tight deadlines with assignments, which means I have had to manage my time well to make sure that I get all my work done and support myself. I also tutored and marked assignments for a 100 level paper, which added significantly to my workload.

    h4 Goal orientated 
    p I am a self-starter and I enjoy working hard. I am also dedicated and challenge myself  to succeed. Jumping into 200 level papers required a high level of self-motivated learning in my own time in order to catch up to those in my class. I relish a challenge. One of my proudest academic achievements is taking Formal Methods, without any previous papers in machine learning or discrete mathematics. My grades are still pending for this paper but I have received A’s in all of the assignments so far.

    h4 Reliable
    p I have an excellent work attendance record and am always on time. I like to get the procedure right and to ensure the tasks set for me are achieved well.

    h4 Nov 2007 – Feb 2008:	Woolworths - Lower Hutt City
    p In order to gain experience in a food-related area I worked full time in the Seafood department. I was responsible for sales, merchandising, preparation of the food areas, and preparation of the food itself. I also took responsibility for ordering stock and administration of the weekly gross profit. I received very good feedback on my customer service and also learnt to create visually exciting displays. After completing my basic training I was offered advanced Grocery Industry training towards Management but chose to go to university. 

    h4 Mar 2008 – Nov 2008:	 Albany Pak'n Save & Foodtown -	Northshore, Auckland
    p Needing to support myself at University, I continued to work in a Supermarket and gained experience in Liquor and General Grocery departments. I moved to the Seafood Department in Pak'n Save Albany in order to work closer to the University. I completed staff training for Health and Safety covering Food Industry Regulations and now have a strong understanding of Food Hygiene and its requirements.

    h4 Nov 2009 - Feb 2009: Goulds Fine Foods - Seaview, Lower Hutt
    p My food technology course required practical work experience so I worked at Goulds. Here I learned about commercial food processes, including design, manufacturing, health and safety, and quality control. I also researched their defrosting system, applying much of the theory from university.

    h4 Feb 2009 - Nov 2011: Albany Students Association - Northshore, Auckland
    p Again to support my studies I worked at the ASA. My role at the ASA was to provide a point of contact for student seeking information and support from the ASA, as well as selling a variety of things. I also was required to aid in the organisation of events and promotions. I left as I was heading overseas to the middle east for 2 months and would be studying in Palmerston North afterwards.
   
    h4 Nov 2009 - May 2010: Nosh - Mt Eden, Auckland
    p Over the summer, the hours at the ASA job would be reduced and in order to have full time work I worked at Nish Mt Eden. Here I worked in the butchery/seafood department and storeroom. I continued to develop my ability to sell. Also I organised the way that the stock was stored for the entire store.

    h4 Jul 2013 - Nov 2013: Massey University - Palmerston North
    p I tutored for a 100 level paper (Computational Thinking and Algorithms). During this time I learnt a lot about working with other’s styles of both programming and teaching. I personally believe teaching others and finding multiple ways of explaining concepts is one the best ways of reinforcing my own learning and understanding of a topic.
